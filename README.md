# SRescue
This website SRescue is built for FirstNet Public Safety Hackathon. Its purpose is to display critical data about the victims and the firefighters through Samsung Gear through FirstNet mobile network so the commanders can deploy personnel and coordinate search efforts. SRescue won two prizes – Best Use of ESRI Technology and Best App Overall (3rd Prize) – in the hackathon.

# Summary
SRescue serves three main functions:

(1) It tracks the location/movement and monitors health information of victims (dots) and firefighters (dots with ID above). Yellow color code means "needs help" while red color code means "in danger".

In our demo, there are 3 firefighters and 2 victims. One of the firefighters (#03) is trapped and #02 firefighter rescues him. #01 firefighter rescues the 2 victims. The color change in the dots shows how health information is monitored.

(2) It allows the commander to visualize the 3D structure of the building
